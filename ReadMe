Hello, just a note about my data sets and code. While the code will throw some red text, those remarks do not keep the code from running. One of these "errors" I get is during the content transformation of the data, which reads "Transformation drops document." I'm not sure what that means, but the code does produce the desired effect on the data, nonetheless. Also, we were required to incorporate some machine learning code into this project as part of the Harvard University capstone; however, sentiment analysis alone was effective for the goals of this project.
